    "# Strain stratification\n",
    "\n",
    "Summer provides a special disease-strain stratification class ([StrainStratification](../api/stratification.rst#summer2.stratification.StrainStratification)) that treats each stratum as a separate strain of the infection. This allows you to model multiple strains of an infection (or multiple infectious diseases with similar compartmental structures) which are able to infect people separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "They key difference between StrainStratification vs. a normal Stratification is that the strain stratification adjusts the count of infectious people per strain. For example, in a normal stratification with an age-based split into 'young' and 'old' you will have frequency-dependent infection flows calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find a common force of infection for both young and old\n",
    "num_infected = num_old_infected + num_young_infected\n",
    "force_of_infection = contact_rate * num_infected / num_pop\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use that common force of infection to get flow rates for young/old infection \n",
    "infect_rate_young = force_of_infection * num_young_susceptible\n",
    "infect_rate_old = force_of_infection * num_old_susceptible\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider now how this will be calculated for two strains (\"mild\" and \"wild\") when applied to an unstratified susceptible compartment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find a different force of infection for mild and wild\n",
    "force_of_infection_mild = contact_rate * num_infected_mild / num_pop\n",
    "force_of_infection_wild = contact_rate * num_infected_wild / num_pop\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the different force of infection values to get flow rates for mild/wild infection \n",
    "infect_rate_mild = force_of_infection_mild * num_susceptible\n",
    "infect_rate_wild = force_of_infection_wild * num_susceptible\n",
