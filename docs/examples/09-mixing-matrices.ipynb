    "# Mixing matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "By default the Summer compartmental model assumes that each person in the model comes into contact with every other person at the same rate (homogeneous mixing). This isn't always true. It may be the case, for example, that children tend to interact more with other children, and less with the elderly (with-like or assortative mixing). This difference in social mixing can be expressed and modelled using a \"mixing matrix\". A NxN matrix which defines how each N strata of a stratification interact and may infect each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a 'child'/'adult' stratification, we could have the following mixing matrix (arbitrary numbers):\n",
    "\n",
    "| | child | adult |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| child | 0.2 | 0.3 |\n",
    "| adult | 0.5 | 0.7 |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mixing matrix, the columns are the infectors and the rows the infected. So the above matrix represents the following infector -> infected relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "| | child | adult |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **child** | child -> child | adult -> child |\n",
    "| **adult** | child -> adult | adult -> adult |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This worked example may clarify. We will calculate the frequency-dependent infection rates for adults and children using the above mixing matrix. Assume the following scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1000 people, 10 infected, 990 susceptible\n",
    "- 80% of the population is adults, 20% are children\n",
    "- So, 800 adults with 792 susceptible and 8 infected; and\n",
    "- 200 children with 198 susceptible and 2 infected\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "child_force_of_inf = 0.2 * 2 / 200 + 0.3 * 8 / 800\n",
    "adult_force_of_inf = 0.5 * 2 / 200 + 0.7 * 8 / 800\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here we assume the contact rate accounts for the use of a mixing matrix .\n",
    "child_inf_rate = contact_rate * child_force_of_inf * 198\n",
