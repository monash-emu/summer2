The notebooks in the ./text_figures/ folder of 
the summer-vynnycky-white-validation repository were used to
generate these CSVs against which the current behaviour is compared
in the tests in test_vynnycky_white_figures.py
(with some minimal additional wrangling of the outputs
to generate dataframes from which the to_csv method was called).
